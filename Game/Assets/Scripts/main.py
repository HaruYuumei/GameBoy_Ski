#           The midsummer flowers are blooming along the Tama River again this year
#               We're all waiting for you in the apartment 707.
#                    I had matching Yukata made for us too... "

#       "The summer you couldn't get back...
#           The summer you wanted more than anyone...
#            ...is here now.
#        I'll keep waiting...
#         ...ten, twenty, fifty years."
